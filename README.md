Task : Make a Guess a Number With the help of JAVA

In this Guessing Game:
ğŸ‘‰ It generates a random number between 1 and 100.
ğŸ‘‰ It creates a scanner to read user input.
ğŸ‘‰ It initializes the number of guesses to 0.
ğŸ‘‰ It starts a game loop.
ğŸ‘‰ In the game loop, it prompts the user to enter a guess.
ğŸ‘‰ It reads the user's guess and increments the number of guesses.
ğŸ‘‰ It checks if the guess is correct.
ğŸ‘‰ If the guess is correct, it breaks out of the game loop and congratulates the user.
ğŸ‘‰ If the guess is incorrect, it gives the user feedback on their guess.
ğŸ‘‰ The game loop continues until the user guesses the correct number or runs out of guesses.
